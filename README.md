Procedural fractal generator

24/08/2017: Apparently, this type of fractal was already described in Beniot B. Mandelbrot's 1977 book "[The Fractal Geometry of Nature](https://ordinatous.com/pdf/The_Fractal_Geometry_of_Nature.pdf)".
There he describes this type of fractal as "curdling clusters". Image examples similar to this program can be seen in page 124.

Here is an interesting excerpt from the book.
>ETYMOLOGY: _Curd_ derives from the old English _crudan_, 'to press, to push hard.' 
>Note the following free associations: 
>curds → cheese → milk → Milky Way → Galaxy(γαλα = milk) → galaxies. 
>I coined curdling while working on galaxies, and the etymological undertones of "galactic curdling" did not escape my notice.
